{-
   This module provides a function to inject artificial errors in
   a target GCL program. Given a program P, the function mutateProgram P
   produces a list of 'mutants'. Each mutant is a pair of (mty,P') where
   P' is a copy of P, which just one mutation/change in its code
   (e.g. some expression "x<n" is changed to "x<=n"). This mutation is
   meant to simulate some error made by a programmer. Importantly, note
   that each mutant only has ONE change.
   The "mty" part indicates the type of mutation, e.g. ROR_LTE_LT means
   that the mutation injected changes some "<=" to "<".

   You can use mutants to test the strength of your test-suite, or your
   verification. Since a mutant represents an error, a good test suite
   should be able to detect it (that it is an erronous instance of P).
   We then say that your test-suite (or verification) "kills" the mutant.
   Given a bunch of generated mutants, ideally your test-suite should
   be able to kill them all.

   The above use of mutants to test your test-suite is also called
   "mutation test" (so... note that in mutation testing you don't test
   P, but rather, you test P's test-suite).

   It is important for you to realize the following:

   (1) The implementation below does not actually check if each mutation
   is semantically unique. That is, that each mutant P' would behave
   differently than other generated mutants, as well as the original P.
   Proving this is theoretically undecidable.

   (2) As a consequence of (1), a mutant P' may turn out to be
   semantically non-mutant. That is, P' turn out to be semantically
   equivalent to P. Such a mutant P' is called an "equivalent mutant".
   Proving that a mutant is an equivalent mutant is also theoretically
   undecidable.
   This also implies, that if your test-suite fails to kill some mutant,
   there is no general method to decide if the failure is due to
   your test-suite's incompleteness, or duNe to the mutant being an
   equivalent mutant. This implies that you will have to inspect the
   case mannually.
